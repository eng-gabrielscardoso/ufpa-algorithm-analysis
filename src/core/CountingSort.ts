/**
 * CountingSort Algorithm
 *
 * In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection 
 * of objects according to keys that are small positive integers; that is, it 
 * is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the number of 
 * objects that possess distinct key values, and applying prefix sum on those 
 * counts to determine the positions of each key value in the output sequence. 
 * Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference 
 * between the maximum key value and the minimum key value, so it is only 
 * suitable for direct use in situations where the variation in keys is not 
 * significantly greater than the number of items. It is often used as a 
 * subroutine in radix sort, another sorting algorithm, which can handle 
 * larger keys more efficiently.
 * 
 * Counting sort is not a comparison sort; it uses key values as indexes into
 * an array and the Î©(n log n) lower bound for comparison sorting will not
 * apply. Bucket sort may be used in lieu of counting sort, and entails a
 * similar time analysis. However, compared to counting sort, bucket sort
 * requires linked lists, dynamic arrays, or a large amount of pre-allocated
 * memory to hold the sets of items within each bucket, whereas counting sort
 * stores a single number (the count of items) per bucket.
